The smallest money conversion library that actually works.  
`25` lines of code, `0` dependencies.  
  
Install with `npm i money-exchange`.  

## Usage

const Money = require("money-exchange");
const fx = new Money();

    fx.convert(68, "USD", "EUR"); // 60.9647
});
```

## API

#### .init(source)
You'll need to init the library first to make it work. Init installs currency data from https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest .  
If this API will die you can set other one, there's a lot of websites providing same JSON syntax tree.  
  
Returns promise.  
#### .convert(amount, from, to)
Converts money. you can see all currencies with `.rates`.

Returns number.
#### .rates
Object with currency rates. 


## Running without currency data provider

You can set your own currencies in `.rates` object. Don't forget that base currency should equal `1`.

*Example:*
```js
const Money = require("money-exchange");
const fx = new Money();

fx.rates = {
    "BTC": 1,
    "ETH": 0.022,
    "DASH": 0.0111
};

fx.convert(15, "ETH", "BTC");
```
